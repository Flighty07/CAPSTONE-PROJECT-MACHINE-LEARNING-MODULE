# Netflix and Movies Dataset Analysis Project

## Introduction
This project focuses on data analysis and machine learning using the Netflix and movies dataset. We employ unsupervised learning techniques to uncover patterns and insights in the data and perform hypothesis testing to validate our findings. The goal is to analyze movie and TV show data to understand viewing trends, genre popularity, and other relevant metrics.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Unsupervised learning (clustering and dimensionality reduction)
- Hypothesis testing
- Visualization of results
